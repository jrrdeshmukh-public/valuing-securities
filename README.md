## Key Sections

### 1. Defining a Security

- A security is defined as a non-negative future benefit agreement between two parties.
- Valuation hinges on risk (internal shortcomings to secure wealth) and opportunity cost.
- Investment decision is framed through debtor growth rates and appropriate discounting.

### 2. Value at Risk (VaR) Repurposed

- **New Perspective:** VaR interpreted as personal capital retention during investment horizon.
- **Example Calculation:** 30-day, 95% confidence VaR estimated at $12.02 on a $144.16 investment.
- **Important Notes:** Addresses volatility estimation, subjective risk tolerance, and limitations of traditional VaR.

### 3. Factor Attribution

- Evaluates external and internal factors driving wealth accumulation:
  - Market exposure
  - Liquidity risk
  - Idiosyncratic risk (specific to OST)
  - Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors
- Emphasizes the impact of changing debt-to-equity ratios on financial health and growth prospects.

### 4. Discounting and Appreciating Viewpoints

- **Investor Credibility Focus:** Discount rates influenced by debtor's financial discipline and market trust.
- Discusses traditional theories like Trade-off and Pecking Order Theories while highlighting real-world perception impacts.

### 5. Exercising Valuation

- Comprehensive decision framework:
  - Compare market price vs. intrinsic value.
  - Evaluate transaction costs and rights conferred by the security.
  - Conduct a risk-adjusted comparison with alternative investments.

### 6. Conclusion

- Security valuation is a personalized, multi-faceted process combining quantitative models with subjective judgement.
- Successful investment decision-making depends on balancing potential risks, returns, and individual investor objectives.
